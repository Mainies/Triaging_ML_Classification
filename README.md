# ED_final_repo

This repo is a collection of my Machine Learning Analysis and bias review as part of a recent university course.

The main file is nurse_ai.ipynb which demonstrates NLP, Data cleaning, ML and Bias detection using IBM's AIFairness 360 Module.

The other notebooks demonstrate similar skills that supplemented the findings in nurse_ai.ipynb but the focus of the delivered assignment was in this file.
