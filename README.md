# Machine Learning and Bias Detection in Triage Classification

This repository contains a collection of machine learning analyses and bias reviews completed as part of a recent university course. The primary focus of this repository is the `nurse_ai.ipynb` notebook, which showcases a comprehensive demonstration of natural language processing (NLP), data cleaning, machine learning (ML), and bias detection using IBM's AIFairness 360 module.

## Project Highlights

- **Main Notebook:** [`nurse_ai.ipynb`](nurse_ai.ipynb) - The central piece of this repository, this Jupyter notebook provides a detailed exploration of NLP, data cleaning, ML techniques, and bias detection. It serves as the primary deliverable for the assignment.

- **Supplementary Notebooks:** Additional notebooks (`notebook1.ipynb`, `notebook2.ipynb`, etc.) are also included, which demonstrate similar skills and techniques that complement the findings in `nurse_ai.ipynb`.

The primary objective of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning and bias detection, and the `nurse_ai.ipynb` notebook is the culmination of these efforts.

## How to Explore

1. Start by opening the [`nurse_ai.ipynb`](nurse_ai.ipynb) notebook to dive into the primary content of this project.

2. You can also explore the supplementary notebooks to gain further insights into related topics and skills.
